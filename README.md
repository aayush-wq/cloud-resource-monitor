# Cloud Resource Monitor

This is a lightweight Python-based tool that monitors system resource usage in real-time — including CPU, memory, and disk usage. It simulates resource tracking on an edge device or cloud node.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time CPU, memory, and disk usage stats
- Refreshes every 5 seconds
- Simple and clean CLI output
- Uses the psutil library

## 🧠 Purpose

This project reflects my interest in cloud computing and sustainable resource management. It was designed to be minimal, understandable, and ready for potential integration into larger monitoring systems.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (python --version)
2. Install dependencies:
pip install psutil

📦 Requirements

Python 3.x
psutil
